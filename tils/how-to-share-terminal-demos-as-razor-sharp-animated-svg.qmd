title: How to share terminal demos as razor-sharp animated SVG

1. Install [asciinema](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema) and [svg-term-cli](https://github.com/marionebl/svg-term-cli).
2. Record with asciinema:

    ```bash
    asciinema rec demo.cast
    ```

    This records the session in the [asciicast v2 plaintext file format](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/blob/develop/doc/asciicast-v2.md) (newline-delimited JSON with an initial header object followed by a timestamped event stream of stdin and stdout).
3. Convert the `.cast` file to `.svg` with svg-term-cli:

    ```bash
    svg-term --in demo.cast --out demo.svg --window --width 80 --height 22 --no-optimize
    ```

    - You probably want to play around with `width` and `height`
    - `window` adds a fake OS window around the terminal session
    - I found that `no-optimize` fixed some weird font rendering issues on my macOS -- not sure why

Here's an example I created for my blog post [_Build a text editor with Python and curses_](/posts/editor.qmd):
