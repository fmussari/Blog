    "Inspired by [Simon Willison](https://til.simonwillison.net/), I started writing [TILs](/tils/) (today I learned). I find it incredibly helpful to write as I code, but most of that writing has never left my private notebooks. TILs are my attempt at documenting and sharing my day-to-day learnings in case they might help others. The focus on learning also feels less daunting than writing blog posts.\n",

    "This is my favourite part! At this point, you should have two working listings, but TIL article URLs will be the same as any other article. Pelican determines the URL and output location of an article by calling `format` with the article's metadata on strings `ARTICLE_URL` and `ARTICLE_SAVE_AS`. That means we can implement a tiny string class with a custom `format` to dynamically set the URL of TILs to `tils/{slug}` and of posts to `posts/{slug}`!"
