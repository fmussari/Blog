I just published a page in the [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai) documentation that I'm particularly proud of: [Notebook best practices](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/best_practices.html). It contains all of the practices we use to write great notebooks. Many thanks to [Hamel](https://twitter.com/HamelHusain) and [Jeremy](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) for their thoughtful contributions and feedback.

You can follow the conversation on Twitter:

I really love the preview image! It's an excerpt from [Marie Curie's research notebook](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/cywqefw4/items?canvas=82) dated 19-21 January 1900.
I could pick out a few words here and there: a l'air (looks), rien (nothing), alumin (aluminium), frod (cold), chauff√© (heated), and parafin.
Unfortunately, I don't know much more than that!
Please [let me know](https://twitter.com/wasimlorgat/status/1571298832885100545?s=20&t=rSYu2_X3IOFteQ39py3ygg) if you do!
