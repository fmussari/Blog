    "Diffusion models[^name] (DMs) are a new class of _deep generative models_. At a high level, the goal of generative modeling is to learn how to create new data points that are similar to a given dataset. For example, given the MNIST dataset---a collection of small black-and-white pictures of digits---a generative model would be able to create entirely pictures of digits that look similar to those in the original dataset. _Deep_ generative models are those that use deep learning methods. Other classes of deep generative models include variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs).\n",

In fact, many improvements following their introduction did so by deviating from the original mathematical formulation! I wrote this because I think that the math is beautiful. I wanted to understand that beauty myself (as a non-mathematician) and to make it accessible to others."

It's common to see mathematical writing as dense as this (and often more). This brevity allows mathematicians to develop new ideas. By assuming that the reader is familiar with all of the prerequisites, the authors are able to focus on only the new parts. The trade-off is that new readers have to do a lot more work upfront."

For example, if we were using the MNIST dataset, then $\\mathbf x^{(0)}$ is a randomly sampled image that looks like an MNIST digit.
