# 👋🏽 Hi, I'm Wasim

I'm a machine learning engineer and aspiring entrepreneur.

This is where I write about what I'm working on, which includes [notebook-driven development](/posts/notebook-best-practices.qmd), [artificial intelligence](/posts/math-of-diffusion.qmd), [software design](/posts/editor.qmd), [programming languages](/posts/fastai-array-programming-day-1.ipynb), and [other](/posts/doing-important-work.qmd) [musings](/posts/hats.qmd).

You might also want to check out [my full list of projects](/projects.qmd), [talks](/talks/index.qmd), and [TILs](/tils/index.qmd) (today I learneds).

Previously, I held technical leadership positions in South African AI startups in manufacturing and agriculture. Before that, I was a professional DotA 2 player.
