# Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Wasim

I'm a software engineer, data scientist, and aspiring entrepreneur.

This is where I write about what I'm working on, which includes [notebook-driven development](/posts/notebook-best-practices.qmd), [artificial intelligence](/posts/math-of-diffusion.qmd), [software design](/posts/editor.qmd), [programming languages](/posts/fastai-array-programming-day-1.ipynb), and [other](/posts/doing-important-work.qmd) [musings](/posts/hats.qmd).

You might also want to check out [my TILs](/tils/index.qmd) (today I learneds) and [my full list of projects](/projects.qmd).

Previously, I held technical leadership positions in South African AI startups in manufacturing and agriculture. Before that, I was a professional DotA 2 player.

Using [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) for notebook-driven development but need it adapted to your business needs? Need support architecting and building a machine learning system? Need to implement a novel deep learning technique customized to your use-case?

I'm open to consulting or contract work on a per-project basis. If you'd like to get in touch, please contact me at [mwlorgat@gmail.com](mailto:mwlorgat@gmail.com).
