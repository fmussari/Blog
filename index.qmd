I'm currently building notebook-driven development at [nbdev.fast.ai](https://nbdev.fast.ai/).

I take special interest in the interaction between people and technology, which includes artifical intelligence, software design, and tools for [thinking the unthinkable](http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/).

Before that, I built machine learning systems for agriculture at [Aerobotics](https://www.aerobotics.com/),<br>and for manufacturing at [DataProphet](https://dataprophet.com/).

These days I'm more active on Twitter ([@wasimlorgat](https://twitter.com/wasimlorgat)) than here. You can also reach me via [email](mailto:mwlorgat@gmail.com).
