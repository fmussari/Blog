# Hi, I'm Wasim

::: {.me}
![](images/me.jpeg)
:::

I'm a software engineer and data scientist.

This is where I share lessons learned during my projects, spanning [notebook-driven development](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/best_practices.html), [artificial intelligence](/posts/math-of-diffusion.qmd) and [software design](/posts/editor.qmd).

You might also be interested in [my full list of side projects](/projects.qmd) and [TILs](/tils/index.qmd) (today I learned).

Previously, I held technical leadership positions in South African AI startups in manufacturing and agriculture. Before that, I was a professional DotA 2 player.

## Get in touch

One of my biggest motivations for sharing online is to connect with interesting people from across the world.

Email me at [mwlorgat@gmail.com](mailto:mwlorgat@gmail.com){data-analytics='"Consulting: Click"'} or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wasimlorgat) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wasim-lorgat/) if you'd like to chat!
